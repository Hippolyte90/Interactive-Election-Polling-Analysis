# Web Scraping and Interactive Dashboard

The project involves analyzing election polling data in groups of three by collecting information from assigned Wikipedia pages, cleaning and processing the data using Python (especially Pandas), and creating an interactive interface for users to explore the data. The interface should include visualizations, summary statistics, and manual data entry options, with libraries like Streamlit, Dash, or Tkinter recommended for a user-friendly design.
